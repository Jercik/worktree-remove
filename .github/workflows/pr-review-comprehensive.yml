            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**

               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.

            For top-level comments with general observations, use this collapsible format:

            <details>
            <summary>PR Review Details</summary>
